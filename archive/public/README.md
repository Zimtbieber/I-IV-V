## I-IV-V

This is a small personal React project, to learn a little bit more about the React framework and music theory.

Main functionalities are the KeyPicker / Cirle of Fifths which show what notes/chords are in a certain Key and the Fretboard which shows the notes of a scale/chord on a scaleable Guitar or Bass Fretboard.

This is not the final state of the app.
